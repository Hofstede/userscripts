## Clean up social media content

- [Delete Facebook posts and likes](cleanup/facebook/delete-posts.md)  
  Tries to nuke everything. Might be a bit funky.

- [Delete old Twitter tweets, RTs and Favs](cleanup/twitter/delete-old.md)  
  Works fine (as of 2013-07-31 at least) but has a few know issues due to Twitter limitations or bugs.
